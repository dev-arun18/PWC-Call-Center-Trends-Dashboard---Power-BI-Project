# Call Center Trends Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Overview

This project was created as part of PwC’s digital upskilling initiative, designed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends for a telecom client’s call center operations. The client, PhoneNow, requested a transparent, easy-to-understand dashboard to provide insights into their customer service data, which can serve as a basis for strategic decisions and management discussions.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To define and track KPIs relevant to call center performance.
- To create an interactive dashboard in Power BI that visualizes these KPIs.
- To provide actionable insights based on the analysis of customer and agent behavior.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the following dataset provided by the call center client:

01 Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx: This dataset contains all necessary information on call volumes, customer satisfaction, agent performance, and other relevant metrics.

## Solution Files

The solution to the client's request is presented in the following file:

Call Center Solution.pbix: This Power BI file contains the final dashboard that visualizes the KPIs and provides insights into the call center's performance.

## Supporting Document

For reference, the pwc call center project task.png file includes:

The initial task and the email from the client outlining their specific requirements. This screenshot serves as background information and client expectations for the project.

## KPIs Included

1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: Reflects customer feedback on the service they received.
2. **Total Calls Answered/Abandoned**: Tracks the number of calls handled vs. those that were abandoned.
3. **Calls by Time**: Shows call volume distribution over specific periods (e.g., hourly, daily).
4. **Average Speed of Answer**: Measures how quickly agents are responding to incoming calls.
5. **Agent Performance Quadrant**: A comparison of agents' average handle time (talk duration) vs. the number of calls answered.

## Power BI Features Used

- **Data Modeling**: Ensured structured relationships for accurate calculations and reporting.
- **DAX Formulas**: Used for custom metrics like customer satisfaction score and agent performance indicators.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts, graphs, and tables to easily present complex information.
- **Power Query**: Cleaned and transformed raw data from various sources for analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Allows users to filter and drill down into specific data points for detailed analysis.

## Suggestions and Next Steps

Based on the current trends visualized in the dashboard, some recommendations include:
- **Focus on Reducing Abandoned Calls**: Implement strategies to handle peak call times more efficiently to minimize abandoned calls.
- **Improve Agent Performance**: Use the agent performance quadrant to identify areas for agent training and development.
- **Customer Satisfaction Monitoring**: Continuously track satisfaction scores and correlate them with call handling efficiency for a holistic view.

## How to Use

1. Download the Power BI file from this repository.
2. Open it using Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the dashboard by interacting with various visualizations and filters to gain insights into the call center performance.

## Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides clear visibility into key metrics for call center operations, helping management make informed decisions based on real-time data and long-term trends.
